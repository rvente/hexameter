# Why I "Talk Fancy" All the Time

## Diglossia in Linguistics

This week in Linguistics class, we learned about the paradigm of Diglossia. It's
not easy to pin down in just a few paragraphs, but it's utterly fascinating, so
I'll give it my best try.

Diglossia is the segregation of the use of two language varieties on the basis
of function by members of a speech community. That's a lot to take in, I know. Let's break
it down. If you use one language or dialect in formal contexts, and another in
informal contexts, then you are likely a part of a diglossic (or polyglossic)
speech community. But, like all things in life, it's never quite that simple.
You might already asking yourself, "Wait, diglossia sounds kinda like
bilingualism, how are they different?"

To answer your question, bilingual describes a person who speaks more than one
language. In the words of my Linguistics Professor, "Diglossia refers to a
situation --- usually a national situation --- in which languages are segregated
according to high and low functions." For completion's sake, let's also tackle
bidialectalism, speaking two dialects of the same language.

### Diglossia vs Bilingualism and Bidialectalism.

Let's say you're from Mexico and you speak two languages, Spanish and Mixtec.
You decide what language you use based on context: Mixtec in your local life and
at home, and Spanish at school and whenever you're interacting with the State.
In this situation, you're both bilingual and part of a greater diglossia.
Linguists have named these contexts Low (domestic, local) and High (academic,
national, global). I should clarify, these words don't mean to pass judgment
onto these languages like the phrase "broken language" does. They just refer to
the scope of the language's niche.

The diglossia in Haiti is because people speak one language variety, Creole, in
Low contexts, and another, French, in High contexts. The polyglossia in New York
is due to the huge variety of languages --- Spanish, Chinese languages, Indic
languages, Creole and the list goes on --- spoken in Low contexts whereas
English is the High language.

If Person B is fluent in both Spanish and English because they travel between
England and Spain (and use both Languages in Low and High environments), they're
bilingual, but do not by themselves create diglossia in the respective nations.

A place can be diglossic (or polyglossic) even if it only has speakers of *one*
language. One of the diglossias in New York is due to people speaking both
General American English and Inner City English (aka African American
Vernacular, Black American English, or Ebonics). Even though this is just a
dialect difference, it still counts.

### My Diglossia Story

I think that's enough of an outline to where you could understand where I'm
going with this. As many of you know, I'm a polyglot. I'm fluent in English, I
speak some Spanish, and I'm French-intelligent (as long as it's the
Afro-Caribbean kind). So when I was learning about diglossia, I was very
interested in how I fit into the mess. As you'll see later, this has some
interesting side-effects...

Take these two charts: The first is someone who was born in New York and speaks
no tongues like Inner City English. The second is my language distribution.

#### Language Variety Distribution of a Typical New Yorker

| Context    | Language Variety                |
| :--------: | :-----------------------------: |
| High       | General American English        |
| Low        | Informal / Colloquial English   |

#### My Language Variety Distribution

| Context    | Language Variety          |
| :--------: | :-----------------------: |
| High       | General American English  |
| Low        | Haitian Creole            |


#### Possible Reasons Why

When I immigrated to the US, I learned nothing but General American English. My
teachers said stuff like "ain't is not a word" and "people will respect you more
if you speak *proper* English." When I went home, I spoke Creole. When I watched
television, I heard General American English. I never acquired Inner City
English because 1) I didn't hang around people who did and 2) I was
indoctrinated into this ideology that any other English was *inferior.* It was
not even a "real language." (Now I know better.) So my Low language was always
the Creole I spoke at home. And my High language was always what I learned at
school. For every correction a teacher gave, I assimilated that into my way of
speaking. For every new grammar rule, I added that to my verbal lexicon. You can
probably guess where this is going...

So remember how the Low language is what you speak to you friends and family?
Well obviously, I can't speak Creole to *everyone.* Not everyone understands my
Low Language, so I used the only language I could, English. But not just any
English, *High* English. Let me draw you attention back to that chart from
before: Here, a typical, educated, native born New Yorker:

| Context   | Language Variety                |
| :-------: | :-----------------------------: |
| High      | General American English        |
| Low       | Colloquial English              |

Notice how these speakers have a Low form of English along with its associated
vocabulary. Well, I've never been able to fully acquire any low forms of English
because all of my informal language happened with Creole speakers. Not only did
I not develop Inner City English, but by Grade 5, I failed to fully develop
*any* Low dialects of English. Creole was always my Low dialect. I didn't get it
from my friends (they were just like me). I didn't get it from YouTube (my
YouTube was mostly fun science channels I liked ) I never needed Low English at
home (I just used Creole). At school, the High dialect was always passable (but
importantly, my socialization told me I was speaking the language *correctly.*)
And of course, I can't forget how learning Latin greatly expanded the scope of
my English.

To this point, I've sort of been speaking in absolutes. The truth is that
through the late end of middle school, in High School and now in University, I
do have a Low dialect. It's just not a *pure* dialect so to speak. My language
complexified through the years, and just a few years of exposure here and there
could do nothing to change that. So, I use words like "formidable" express
myself where words like "tough" or "hard" feel like they're lacking something. I
"speak like a rich person," where even my Low language is High when compared to
the norm. To be fair "well spoken" comes up every once in a blue moon. It's
usually from teachers and adults. But yesterday, I got a "You sound so eloquent
when you speak" from one of my peers. I couldn't help but smile after that.

I've been told I speak like I'm reading out an essay. I've been told that I
sound pretentious, jargony, *excessive.* I've even been accused of using words
whose meanings I don't know. Those may be passable impulses, but they're not
*nuanced*. If you want a better theory than "He just wants to sound smarter than
the rest of us," here's your perfectly laid out reason why. Of course, I'm not
justifying anything, really. I'm just describing it. No one needs to (or should
ever have to) justify how they speak to anyone else. I just had this epiphany
and I just couldn't help but share it.

#### Moving Forward

So what do I make make of this? To no one's surprise, I have really grown to
like speaking the way I do. I'm a glossophile in one of the craziest languages
in the world, *of course* I'm going to keep using all of those pentasyllabics. I
genuinely enjoy it. But that's the extent of it. I've been done correcting
spoken grammar since when I quit being an SAT tutor, and I'm not about to start now. So
I guess I'm just this one rare case in a phenomenon way bigger than me, and there's
nothing wrong with that.

Now's the only point in my life, really, where I've had a permanent speech
community of people speaking Low English. But looking around, they're all
college students like me, busy "sounding smart" and stuff. So maybe I'll get a
natural Low English variety that everyone's accustomed to. Or maybe my old
habits will hang on for a bit longer. Whatever happens, I'm just thankful for my
great education, and I'm glad to be here for the ride.
